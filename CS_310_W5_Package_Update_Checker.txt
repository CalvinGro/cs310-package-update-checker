1. How did you get the list of packages?

    I got the list of packages using apt list --upgradable, which 
    creates a list of every package that could be upgraded
2. What is the crontab sequence to run the script?

    I used the sequence: @weekly \home\frogg\Programming\Bash\pkg-check.sh

3. Since this script would require root, how do you install a crontab for root?

    I installing the script with sudo crontab -e, which lets me edit the crontab with root controls.
    Here is exactly what i did:

    sudo crontab -e
    [sudo] password for frogg:
    no crontab for root - using an empty one

    Select an editor.  To change later, run 'select-editor'.
      1. /bin/nano        <---- easiest
      2. /usr/bin/vim.basic
      3. /usr/bin/vim.tiny
      4. /bin/ed

    Choose 1-4 [1]: 1

    THEN IN THE CRONTAB I INPUTED: @weekly \home\frogg\Programming\Bash\pkg-check.sh

    crontab: installing new crontab
